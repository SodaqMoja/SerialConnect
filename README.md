This is an Arduino library to connect two devices via
a serial line.

The code was developed to be used for the Sodaq Moja
board.  But it is general purpose, so it can be used
in other environments too. SODAQ boards can easily be
connected with a grove cable and with the help of
SoftwareSerial. Don't forget to switch RX/TX in the
two sketches.
